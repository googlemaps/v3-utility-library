KeyDragZoom for V3
===================

## Description

This library adds a drag zoom capability to a V3 Google map. When drag zoom is enabled, holding down a designated hot key (shift | ctrl | alt) while dragging a box around an area of interest will zoom the map in to that area when the mouse button is released. Optionally, a visual control can also be supplied for turning a drag zoom operation on and off. Only one line of code is needed: google.maps.Map.enableKeyDragZoom();

NOTE: Do not use Ctrl as the hot key with Google Maps JavaScript API V3 since, unlike with V2, it causes a context menu to appear when running on the Macintosh.
Note that if the map's container has a border around it, the border widths must be specified in pixel units (or as thin, medium, or thick). This is required because of an MSIE limitation.
