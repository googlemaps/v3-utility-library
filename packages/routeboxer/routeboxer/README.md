RouteBoxer
==========

## Description

The RouteBoxer class takes a path, such as the Polyline for a route generated by a Directions request, and generates a set of LatLngBounds objects that are guaranteed to contain every point within a given distance of that route. These LatLngBounds objects can then be used to generate requests to spatial search services that support bounds filtering (such as the Google Maps Data API) in order to implement search along a route. 

RouteBoxer overlays a grid of the specified size on the route, identifies every grid cell that the route passes through, and generates a set of bounds that cover all of these cells, and their nearest neighbours. Consequently the bounds returned will extend up to ~3x the specified distance from the route in places.
